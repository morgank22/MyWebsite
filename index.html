                            <br>
                            My name is Morgan Kennedy and I am 21-years old. I was born in a small town called Mount Olive, NC and I am currently living in Wilmington, NC.
                            After I graduated high school, I attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for my undergraduate degree.
                            I graduated from UNC in May of 2024 with a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science and Information Science.
                            After I graduated with my Bachelors degree I decided to pursue my Masters degree in Fall 2024 at the University of North
                            Carolina Wilmington. I am pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science and Information Systems where I am intended to
                            graduate in May 2026. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For my career goals, I am openminded and have many interests in different types of positions. For example, I have played and loved
                            video games since I was a child and believe it would be a great to have a career in game development. Another idea I have considered is
                            looking for technical opportunities in the healthcare, business, and cybersecurity fields. Some specific positons could include a Data Scientist,
                            Healthcare Data Analyst, Risk Analyst, etc. Therefore, I am exploring a wide range of opportunities to determine which field will be best based on my 
                            skills and long-term goals.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I am in the process for looking to acquire an internship for the summer of 2025.

                                <p>Our project guidelines were to create a website about any mythological figures we wanted to talk about
                                    and give an informative background on the specific person/creature we chose. I chose to create a website
                                    based on the Greek goddess Athena. In this project, I wrote about her life which included her background,
                                    virtues/symbols, and wraths versus favors for others. Additionally, I wrote about wars she was apart
                                    of such as the Trojan war and I wrote about how Athens was named after her.

                                    Here people would be able to look at different cities (Barcelona, Berlin, Bangelore, Dallas, 
                                    London, New York, Paris, and San Francisco) and be able to see what fun activities they have such
                                    as restaurants, hotels, and excursions. This website would make you create an account then you
                                    would be able to search the different cities. From there, you could wishlist or heart a location or activity
                                    which would save them for later on your profile.

                                <br><h3>The Hearts Card Game</h3>
                                <p>The Game of Hearts is a common and popular card game where it involves at least four players and
                                    the main point of the game is you want to get rid of all your cards that are hearts because they will
                                    give you points and you want to have the fewest points as possible. Therefore, whichever suit is laid down first
                                    (Clubs, Hearts, Spades, or Diamonds) every other player must lay down a card of the same suit but if you do 
                                    not have that suit then you can lay down any card (stategy wise: laying down a card that has the suit hearts
                                    would be smart because the player with the highest numbered card with the suit in the current pile has to take the heart card).
                                    At the end of each round, all points are counted and the first player to 100 points hundred loses. Each heart card
                                    is worth one point but the queen of spades is worth 13 points.

                                <br><h3>Akari Puzzles</h3>
                                <p>Akari is a game/logic puzzle where there is a grid and you have place light bulbs in different parts to light up
                                    the whole board. The light bulbs can be placed in the corridor cells but cannot be placed in the clue or wall cells.
                                    When a light bulb is placed it will light up the grid in the left, right, up, and down directions and light 
                                    bulbs cannot be placed in the direct line of sight of each other. Additionally, the clue cells will be numbered between
                                    0-4 which will tell you how many light bulbs are around this clue cell. Once the right number of light bulbs
                                    are placed beside a clue cell it will be consider satisified. The way the player wins the game/puzzle is by
                                    lighting up the whole board correctly and satisifying all clue cells.
