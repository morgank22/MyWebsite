    <h3>
        Historical Website about Greek Mythology:
    </h3>

    <div class="HistoryPara">
    <p>
        Our project guidelines were to create a website about any mythology we wanted to talk about
        and give an informative background on the specific person we chose. I chose to create a website
        based on the Greek goddess Athena. In this project, I wrote about her life which included her background,
        virtues/symbols, and wraths versus favors for others. Additionally, I wrote about wars she was apart
        of such as the Trojan war and I wrote about how Athens was named after her.

        A Traveling Page:

    <div class="TravelPara">
    <p>
        The main goal of this project was to create a website that resembled travel agency websites.
        Here people would be able to look at different cities (Barcelona, Berlin, Bangelore, Dallas, 
        London, New York, Paris, and San Francisco) and be able to see what fun activities they have such
        as restaurants, hotels, and excursions. This website would make you create an account then you
        would be able to search the different cities. From there, you could wishlist or heart a location or activity
        which would save them for later on your profile.

        The Game of Hearts:
    </h3>

    <div class="HeartPara">
    <p>
        The Game of Hearts is a common and popular card game where it involves at least four players and
        the main point of the game is you want to get rid of all your cards that are hearts because they will
        give you points and you want to have as few of points as possible. Therefore, whichever suit is laid down first
        (Clubs, Hearts, Spades, or Diamonds) every other player must lay down a card of the same suit but if you do 
        not have that suit then you can lay down any card (stategy wise: laying down a card that has the suit hearts
        would be smart because the player with the highest numbered card with the suit in the current pile has to take the heart card).
        At the end of each round, all points are counted and the first player to 100 points hundred loses. Each heart card
        is worth one point but the queen of spades is worth 13 points.

        Akari Game:
    </h3>

    <div class="AkariPara">
    <p>
        Akari is a game/logic puzzle where there is a grid and you have place light bulbs in different parts to light up
        the whole board. The light bulbs can be placed in the corridor cells but cannot be placed in the clue or wall cells.
        When a light bulb is placed it will light up the grid in the left, right, up, and down directions and light 
        bulbs cannot be placed in the direct line of sight of each other. Additionally, the clue cells will be number between
        0-4 which will tell you how many light bulbs are around this clue cell. Once the right number of light bulbs
        are placed beside a clue cell it will be consider satisified. The way the player wins the game/puzzle is by
        lighting up the whole board correctly and satisifying all clue cells.
