            A Brief Introduction About Me
        </h2>
        <div class="IntroText">
            <p>
                My name is Morgan Kennedy and I am 21-years old. I was born in a small town called Mount Olive, NC and currently living in Wilmington, NC.
                After I graduated high school, I attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for my undergraduate degree.
                I graduated from UNC in May of 2024 with a degree in Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Information Science.
                After I graduated with my Bachelors degree I decided to pursue my Masters degree in Fall 2024 at the University of North
                Carolina Wilmington. I am pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science and Information Systems where I am intended to
                graduate in May 2026. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For my career goals, I am openminded and have many interests in different types of positions. For example, I have played and loved
                video games since I was a child and believe it would be a great to have a career in game development. Another idea I have considered is
                for working for a business, bank, or even a hospital and do some of the technical work for them with jobs such as a Data Scientist,
                IT Risk Management, Clincial Anaylst, Health IT Security Specialist, etc. Therefore, I have a wide range of interests that I am looking for 
                or that I am looking into.
